- Don't forget to check for commented/uncommented functions within the code.
    You'll have to comment out any functions not present on the server.

- For arguments including spaces such as players names or message strings, use '~'
   instead of space. This is just a sideeffect of E2/GMod weirdness.

- Yes, a lot of things are gonna either not fully work, or error out after run.
   This is primarily with spammy commands and it isn't a desired effect, but
    it's the most functionality I have for the time being.
